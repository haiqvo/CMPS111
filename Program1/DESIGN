My Custom Shell

Author : Erik Swedberg, Hai Vo, and Justin Yeo

Purpose:Create a shell that has some basic commands. The goal up-to-date with system programming. 

Assumptions:
1. Input will be by keyboard.
2. Commands based on POSIX systems

 
Data:

No data was used. Command based input.


Operations:

1.execute(char**)
	-Runs execvp
	-Checks every path for specified file defined by the environment
	-Calls set_standard which does the redirects

2.parse(char**)
	-Parses command input for special characters: <>|&
	-Sets the args to be used for execute

3.execute_pipe(char**)
	-Runs the first command and feeds the output as the input for the second command.
	-It will still rely on execute for the execvp 
	-have a different fork from the one found in main.


Algorithms:
	
No algorithms were needed.
